//Time Difference Between Two Time Zones
//Write a program to calculate the time difference between two cities. 
//The program should prompt the user to input the city names
//(e.g., "Asia/Kolkata" and "Europe/London") and calculate the time difference in hours.
//Hint: Use ZoneId and ZonedDateTime to get the current time for each city and 
//find the difference using Duration.between().
